Mehliyar Sadiq modified this surfdata file in May 2019 for POD3 calculation

Three variables are changed based on the original surfdata_1.9x2.5_mp24_simyr2000_c130419.nc file: PCT_PFT, MONTHLY_LAI and MONTHLY_SAI

Mehliyar replaced pft_num from 18-25 with new pft fraction, LAI and SAI, and try to simulate completely new set of crop types:

ipft = 
18 - Maize
19 - Maize 2
20 - Rice
21 - Rice 2
22 - Wheat
23 - Wheat.winter
24 - Soybean
25 - Soybean (same as 24)

1, PCT_PFT = 1 (unit: percent) when Sacks harvest date is available (crop_calendar.RData)
calculated and modified using:
./making_surfdata/code/crop_pft_frac.R

2, MONTHLY_LAI
follows EMEP method of LAI calculation, described in Simpson et al., 2012.
also uses Sacks plant and harvest dates: crop_calendar.RData
calculated and modified using:
./making_surfdata/code/make_lai.R

Note: they both depend on the crop calendar data (crop_calendar.RData) I made, 
using: ./making_surfdata/code/make_crop_calendar.R
based on Sacks et al., 2010
